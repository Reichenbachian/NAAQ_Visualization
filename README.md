# RAAQ_Visualization
A winning project for [HackNEHS](hacknehs.com) for my team. Given a keyword, it scrapes dozens of news sites and finds interrelated keywords, presenting them in a bidirectional graph.

Seeing as how it was written in under eight hours, it still needs some heavy work. My team and I will most likely get back to it in the Spring.

It is currently hosted at [raq.world](http://www.raq.world)
